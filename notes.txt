Essential coding for AFP interactives

- Basic html, css literacy needed
- learn the differences in html tags, types of blocks etc
- css best in external file sheet -- much easier for reusing code
- keep in mind the hierarchy of Cascading Style Sheets
- USe blocks and colums to organise for responsive design
- Use media query (@media) for switching page organisation for different screen sizes
- Take note of margins, paddings. Learn to use them to organise the page
- Likewise with positions, absolute, relative
- Use vue.js to separate content from html structure. Binds data to html.
- Also explore other aspects of vue.js, many useful tools
- Bootrstrap can also be used
- D3 binds data to svg's. It is a very useful tool and we need to get D3 proficiency into the HK team.
